## Introduction
The main goal of this project is analyzing some marketing data. An Exploratory Data Analysis will be performed for some significant variables from the marketing data, and some interesting patterns and insights of the data will be interpreted clearly and concisely.
It can be found more information about the dataset on this link: https://www.kaggle.com/jackdaoud/marketing-data

## Data Description
1. The dataset consists of 2240 rows (observations) and 28 columns (variables).
2. The majority of the variables are integers.
3. The income variable is declared as an object and has some missing values (24), which requires some cleaning to conduct EDA.
4. The column names need to be renamed to meaningful purposes.
5. We can use summary statistics on numerical variables.

## Data As a Whole
There are several ways to analyze every single variable of the dataset at the same time; in this porject, the Exploratory Data Analysis will conduct some visualization techniques, such as ploting histograms and creating heatmaps for numerical variables in order to determine the correlation and association between each variable.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Most of the variables are right-skewed and have similar distributions.
- Most of the variables have a weak positive correlation to each other. However, there is a variability of correlations between numerical variables the income variable.
- 18 to 35 and More than 70 groups tend to be the least interested in deals purchases.
On average, More than 70 group customers tend to shop the most online, in store, and through the catalog.
- 36 to 50 and 51 to 70 groups are more interested in deals. It might be because they receive more deals based on loyal customers.
- This analysis could be very helpful for a marketing department; some strategies could be used to increase the customers of the age groups that are less interested in purchases for the store.

## Conclusion
It has been demostrated that income variable has a strong positive linear relationship with customers' purchase behavior. Interesting insights could be found based on the analysis performed to the education, age, and age_group variables; such insights could be very helpful for market strategies to increase the sales of different products and to increase the number of customers for purchasing different itmes.

## Next Steps
There were some other variables that have not been analyzed yet; some future analysis is considered for customer marital status, geographical data, and customer complains.
